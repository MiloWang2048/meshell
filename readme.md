# meshell

yet another shell homework.

stars/forks/PRs/issues welcomed.

## System requirement

meshell is linux oriented, and was developed in Ubuntu 18.04.

I'm not sure whether it can work well with another linux release or not.

## Getting started

```sh
# clone to local
git clone https://github.com/MiloWang2048/meshell
cd meshell
# build
make
# run
./mesh
```
